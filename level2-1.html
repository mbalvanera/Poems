        <h3>The essence of</h3><br> your being is here<br> to <em>stay</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
as it infuses with my skin and heart and eyes and touch
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>my skin</li> 
                <li>has been tattooed</li> <li><em>through your caress</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
<strong>and my heart has been<br> mended by the way your<br> eyes peer into my soul you fill me with love and <br>make me whole</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
<h1>in retrospect i truly</h1> <h2>thought i knew what love was</h2>
<h3>but this was all a lie until i had met you</h3>
<h4>masochistic obsession is all i was familiar with
    blinking the past away</h4>
<h5>i am aware of you and our future and our present</h5>
and how i will never let that get away<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I never knew you could know<br> me so much better<br>
            <ul>
                <li>I ignored all the great weather</li> 
                <li>the darkest cloud hung over me</li>
                <li>and I let my head fall on the air</li>
                <li>my hair was still wet but not the day that we met</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
<em>Was it someone like you who did it<br> to be so kind<br>
Leaves on the grass with words drawn<br> out<br>
You admired me and wanted to hold my<br> hand
I let the curtains fly in<br>
    Didn’t want the wind to pass me by<br></em>
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans<br>
Dropping love on my sleeve<br>
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen<br>
    I never knew a heart could beat for<br> me</strong>
        </p>
